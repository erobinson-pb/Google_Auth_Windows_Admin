## About Google Authenticator administrator for Windows

Google Authenticator administrator for Windows is a simple .Net C# WPF application to allow system administrators to generate Google Authenticator setup codes in QR Code or plain text format for users of Google Authenticator.  The tool was designed as part of a Google Authenticator 2 factor authentication solution for RDP for our own use at Project Balance but can be used for any Google Authenticator implementation.
